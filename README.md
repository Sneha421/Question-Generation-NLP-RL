# Question-Generation-NLP-RL
This project deals with generating questions from the SQUAD Dataset using RL and NLP

### Introduction
* Question generation (QG) systems generate natural language questions relevant to a given piece of text (contextâ€”typically a sentence or a paragraph) and can usually be answered by just considering the context or a context-answer pair
* This system typically improves question generation, question answering, and information retrieval. 
QG systems can be used in educational institutions to automate the generation of questions given the context.
